# React: Voice Note App

##### January 2021

I built this voice note app to get familiar with the [Web Speech API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API). I used a tutorial to help me get started but I then added this functionality:

- data type the note is saved in from a string to an object.
- ability for important notes to saved in a red color to increase users attention.
- Database so the user can save thier notes and have them shown in date order.
