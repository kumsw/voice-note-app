# React: Voice Note App

##### January 2021

I built this voice note app to get familiar with the [Web Speech API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API). I used a tutorial to help me get started but I then I refactored to include:

- changing th data type for the note from a string to an object.
- fucntionality that a note with the work "important" will be saved in red. To draw attention for the user.
- Back end storage so the notes can be stored and showed in date order (in progress).
