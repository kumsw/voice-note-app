# React: Voice Note App

##### January 2021

I built this voice note app to get familiar with the [Web Speech API](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2013/01/Voice-Driven-Web-Apps-Introduction-to-the-Web-Speech-API). I used a tutorial to help me get started but I then did X, Y,Z

## To Start

Clone the repo as instructed below and install npm modules.

## Installation

1.  Clone the repo<br/>
    `https://github.com/kumsw/weather-app.git`
2.  Download the required npm modules.<br/>
    `npm i`
3.  Open a terminal and start the the React app using the following command:<br/>` npm run start`

## Usage:

Enter location and see the weather. Weather can be toggle to show temperature in farenheit or celsius.

## Main learnings:

- We took time to write a through plan to break down the game into components, states props and what would be rendered. This made the build of the app faily easy.

- By going from class based components to the new style of React I really cemented my previous OOP and classes knowledge.
